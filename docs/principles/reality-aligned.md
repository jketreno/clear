# [R] Reality-Aligned — Your Domain Model Must Match Business Reality

> If your understanding of how the system should work doesn't match reality, AI generates mountains of plausible-but-wrong code. Precise models → correct implementations. Fuzzy models → convincing mistakes.

---

## The Problem

Many systems don't have a single source of truth. They have:

- A database schema (what's stored)
- An API spec (what's served)
- A frontend model (what's displayed)
- An external system (OAuth/IAM provider, config DB) that actually decides state
- Someone's head (what the team thinks the rules are)

When these conflict, AI picks one — often the wrong one. Generated code that disagrees with reality isn't caught by tests (because the tests were written against the same wrong assumption).

The solution: **declare one source of truth per domain concept, and derive everything from it**.

---

## The Three-Question Diagnostic

For any domain concept, answer:
1. **Where is it defined?** (where the schema / type lives)
2. **Where is it validated?** (where inputs are checked)
3. **Where is it enforced?** (where the rule actually has teeth)

If those three answers point to different places → you have drift.

**Example — User Permissions:**
- Defined: local database roles table
- Validated: backend middleware
- Enforced: OAuth/IAM provider

If the IAM provider says a user's admin role was revoked but your local DB still says they're an admin, what's true? The IAM provider is — because it controls what the user can actually access. Your local DB is wrong. Anyone who reads the local DB is granting permissions that shouldn't exist.

---

## Declaring Sources of Truth

In `clear/autonomy.yml`, add a `sources_of_truth` section:

```yaml
sources_of_truth:
  - concept: "User permissions"
    source_of_truth: "OAuth/IAM provider"
    defined_in: "idp.users.roles"
    note: |
      If local DB and IAM provider disagree, the IAM provider is correct.
      Sync jobs run hourly. Webhooks handle real-time updates.

  - concept: "User"
    source_of_truth: "database schema"
    defined_in: "schema.prisma (or schema.sql)"
    note: |
      The Prisma schema is the canonical User definition.
      API response types are derived from it.

  - concept: "Service config"
    source_of_truth: "protobuf definitions"
    defined_in: "proto/config/service.proto"
    note: |
      The config flags in the proto are authoritative.
      All other representations derive from proto generation.

  - concept: "Roles and groups"
    source_of_truth: "OAuth/IAM provider"
    defined_in: "idp.groups"
    note: |
      Group membership and role assignments are managed in the IAM provider.
      Local cache is read-only and must sync before access checks.
```

AI tools are configured to read this section before generating code for any declared concept. They derive from the source, not from existing code.

## Writing Reality Tests

Reality tests verify that your local implementation actually matches the external source of truth. They catch drift before it becomes institutionalized.

**Key properties of reality tests:**
- Run in staging or nightly CI — not on every PR
- Fetch from the real external system (mocked locally = no value)
- Guard with `if (NODE_ENV !== 'staging') throw` to prevent production data access
- Compare normalized representations (timestamps, sorted arrays, etc.)

See `templates/examples/skills/reality-test.md` for complete examples for OAuth/IAM and database schemas.

**Where to put them:**
```
tests/
  reality/              ← Reality tests live here
    iam-permissions.reality.test.ts
    db-schema.reality.test.ts
    api-contract.reality.test.ts
```

**How to run them:**
```bash
# In package.json
"test:reality": "jest tests/reality/ --testPathPattern='reality'"

# In nightly CI (not verify-ci.sh daily check)
npm run test:reality
```

## Reality Test Examples

### IAM permission alignment

```typescript
test('local user roles match IAM provider', async () => {
  const idpUser = await iam.users.get(testUserId);
  const local = await getUserRoles(testUserId);
  
  expect(local?.roles.sort()).toEqual(idpUser.roles.sort());
  expect(local?.isActive).toBe(idpUser.enabled);
  // Don't compare timestamps directly — minor sync lag is expected
});
```

### Database schema alignment

```sql
-- tests/reality/schema.reality.test.sql
-- Run with: psql $DATABASE_URL -f tests/reality/schema.reality.test.sql
-- Fails if expected columns are missing

DO $$
BEGIN
  ASSERT (
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_name = 'users' AND column_name = 'email'
  ) = 1, 'users.email column must exist';
  
  ASSERT (
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_name = 'user_roles' AND column_name = 'idp_role_id'
  ) = 1, 'user_roles.idp_role_id column must exist';
END $$;
```

### External API contract alignment

```typescript
test('API response matches declared OpenAPI schema', async () => {
  const response = await apiClient.get('/users/me');
  const schema = loadOpenApiSchema('openapi.yml', '/users/me', 'get', '200');
  
  // Validate the actual response against the spec
  const result = validateAgainstJsonSchema(response.data, schema);
  expect(result.valid).toBe(true);
  expect(result.errors).toHaveLength(0);
});
```

## Using AI to Detect Existing Drift

Ask your AI to run the three-question diagnostic on a domain concept:

```
Run the CLEAR reality-alignment diagnostic on our User Permissions model:
1. Find where user permissions are defined in our codebase
2. Find where permission data is validated
3. Find where permissions are actually enforced (IAM provider? local DB? middleware?)

List any discrepancies you find between these three places.
Report locations where Subscription fields exist in one place but not another.
```

The AI will surface mismatches you might not have noticed.

---

## When Systems Conflict

Add explicit conflict-resolution rules to `clear/autonomy.yml`:

```yaml
sources_of_truth:
  - concept: "User email"
    source_of_truth: "OAuth/IAM provider"
    defined_in: "idp.users[email]"
    conflict_resolution: |
      The IAM provider is the canonical email source.
      Our DB stores a cached copy for performance.
      If they differ, schedule a sync job — never update the IdP from our DB.
```

AI tools read this and apply the correct resolution when generating sync logic, webhook handlers, or data migration code.

---

## Practical Starting Point

Pick ONE domain concept this week:

1. Name it (User, Order, Subscription, Permission, Product)
2. Answer the three questions (defined where, validated where, enforced where)
3. Declare the source of truth in `clear/autonomy.yml`
4. Write one reality test that would fail if drift occurs
5. Add that test to your nightly CI

That's it. One concept, one test, one declaration. It takes an hour and creates a permanent protection.

## Measuring Success

You know [R] is working when:
- New developers can find the source of truth for any domain concept in 30 seconds
- "Which one is right?" debates about mismatched data have a clear answer
- Drift between external services and local models is caught automatically, not by customers
- AI-generated code for a domain concept is consistently correct because it's derived from a declared source
