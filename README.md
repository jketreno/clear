# CLEAR — AI-Assisted Development Framework

> **C**onstrained · **L**imited · **E**phemeral · **A**ssertive · **R**eality-Aligned

The counterintuitive part of AI-assisted development:

> **More constraints = more autonomy.**
>
> The tighter you define the boundaries, the more you can safely delegate. Loose boundaries mean you're reviewing everything because anything could break anything.
>
> This feels backwards until you try it.

Your architecture rules live in code reviews and tribal knowledge. AI can't read any of that — so it generates code that works but violates your patterns.

CLEAR fixes this: define your rules as automated checks, tell the AI to run them before finishing, and let it self-correct. The AI generates code, runs `verify-ci.sh`, sees the failure, fixes it, and reports done — you never see the violation.

Works with GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, and MCP-compatible agent frameworks.

## Quick Start

### 1 — Install CLEAR into your project

<!-- RELEASE_VERSION_START -->
**Latest release: [v1.1.0](https://github.com/jketreno/clear/releases/tag/v1.1.0)**

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/jketreno/clear/releases/download/v1.1.0/clear-installer-v1.1.0.sh
chmod +x ./clear-installer-v1.1.0.sh
./clear-installer-v1.1.0.sh --target /path/to/your-project
```
<!-- RELEASE_VERSION_END -->

This copies CLEAR's scripts, AI tool configs, and templates into your project. If CLEAR is already installed, the installer updates CLEAR-owned files and preserves your customizations.

It then runs the setup wizard, which uses a hybrid flow: it can install a safe starter `clear/autonomy.yml`
and guide you to run the `autonomy-bootstrap` skill from your AI assistant
(Cursor, Copilot Chat, Claude, etc.) to generate project-specific boundaries and sources of truth.
Manual prompts for boundaries/concepts are still available as a fallback.

### 2 — See it work

```bash
./clear/verify-ci.sh
```

You should see all checks pass. This is the script your AI tool runs before reporting any work as complete. Right now it checks autonomy boundaries and shell compliance. Your project-specific checks come next.

### 4 — Add your first constraint

Open your AI tool (Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor) in your project. It automatically reads the CLEAR config files installed in step 1. Paste this:

```
Analyze this codebase and identify the build tools, linters, test frameworks,
and any existing architecture tests. For each tool found, show me the exact
run_check() line to add to clear/verify-local.sh. Wait for my approval.
```

Review what the AI proposes, approve it, then run `./clear/verify-ci.sh` again — your checks are now enforced.

### 5 — Turn a code review comment into an enforced rule

Think of your most repeated code review comment. Tell your AI tool:

```
I want to turn this code review rule into an enforced constraint:
"[paste your most common review comment here]"

What type of check best enforces this — linter rule, architecture test, or build flag?
Show me the code for the check and the run_check() line for clear/verify-local.sh.
Wait for my approval.
```

From now on, AI self-corrects against that rule before saying "done." You review constraints, not implementations.

## How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    DEV([Developer]) -->|"request"| AI

    subgraph AI["AI Tool (Copilot · Claude · Cursor)"]
        direction TB
        CFG["Reads CLEAR config at session start<br/>.github/copilot-instructions.md<br/>CLAUDE.md · .cursor/rules/"]
        AUT["Checks clear/autonomy.yml<br/>before touching any file"]
        GEN["Generates / modifies code"]
        CFG --> AUT --> GEN
    end

    GEN --> VCI

    subgraph VCI["clear/verify-ci.sh"]
        direction LR
        B[Build] --> L[Lint] --> T[Tests] --> A["Architecture<br/>Tests"] --> G["Autonomy<br/>Guard"]
    end

    VCI -->|"any check fails"| FIX["AI reads errors<br/>and self-corrects"]
    FIX --> GEN
    VCI -->|"all checks pass"| DONE["✅ Done — AI reports complete<br/>Developer commits"]
```

The core rule every AI config enforces:

> **Run `./clear/verify-ci.sh` before reporting work as complete. If it fails, fix the issues and run again. Never say "done" if it fails.**

## The Five Principles

| # | Principle | What it means |
|---|-----------|---------------|
| **C** | **Constrained** | Architecture rules are enforced by scripts and tests, not code review |
| **L** | **Limited** | Modules are tagged `full-autonomy`, `supervised`, or `humans-only` |
| **E** | **Ephemeral** | Generated code is regenerated from source, never hand-edited |
| **A** | **Assertive** | Tests enforce what must always be true, not just confirm the current implementation |
| **R** | **Reality-Aligned** | Domain models derive from a declared single source of truth |

## What Gets Installed

The installer copies these into your project:

```
clear/
  verify-ci.sh          — The enforcement script (CLEAR-owned, updated automatically)
  verify-local.sh       — Your project-specific checks (never overwritten)
  autonomy.yml          — Module boundaries (full-autonomy / supervised / humans-only)
  extensions.yml        — Optional tool extensions (e.g., Lizard complexity analysis)
  principles.md         — AI quick-reference card (read at session start)
  templates/
    architecture-tests/ — Autonomy guard test (copy into your test suite)
    skills/             — AI skills (autonomy bootstrap, MCP server scaffolding, code review)
    linting/            — ESLint config templates (flat, legacy, React/TSX)
    git-hooks/          — Pre-commit hook that runs verify-ci.sh
    github-actions/     — CI/CD workflow template
  examples/             — Domain-specific examples (available separately)
  docs/                 — Agentic workflows & MCP integration guide

CLAUDE.md              — Claude Code config (auto-read at session start)
.github/               — GitHub Copilot instruction files
.cursor/rules/         — Cursor MDC rule files
.claude/commands/      — Claude slash commands (/project:verify, check-autonomy, update-autonomy)
.vscode/               — VS Code tasks, settings, recommended extensions
```

Domain-specific examples (API endpoint skills, type-sync tests, etc.) are available separately:

```bash
# Extract examples on demand (outside onboarding):
./clear-installer-vX.Y.Z.sh --install-examples /path/to/examples
```

---

## Updating CLEAR

When a new version is released, run the installer again against the same project:

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/jketreno/clear/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/clear-installer-vX.Y.Z.sh
bash clear-installer-vX.Y.Z.sh --target /path/to/your-project
```

CLEAR-owned files (`verify-ci.sh`, AI configs, `principles.md`) are updated. Your files (`verify-local.sh`, `autonomy.yml`, `extensions.yml`) are never overwritten.

---

## Alternative: Bootstrap from Source

If you prefer to work from the git repo (for contributing or customizing CLEAR itself):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jketreno/clear
cd clear
./scripts/clear-installer.sh /path/to/your-project                 # install + setup wizard
./scripts/clear-installer.sh --install-examples /path/to/examples  # extract domain-specific examples
./scripts/clear-installer.sh --dry-run /path/to/project            # preview only
./scripts/clear-installer.sh --target /path/to/project             # update an existing CLEAR install
```

The unified installer auto-detects fresh install vs update based on `clear/autonomy.yml`.
