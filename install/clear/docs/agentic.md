# CLEAR with Multi-Agent Pipelines and MCP

> CLEAR was designed for single-session AI tools, but its core primitives — `verify-ci.sh` and `autonomy.yml` — apply equally to orchestrated multi-agent workflows. This guide explains how.

## The Multi-Agent Problem

Single-session AI tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot) load your CLAUDE.md or rule files at startup and carry context throughout the session. Multi-agent pipelines are different:

- **Orchestrators** spawn sub-agents that may not share session context
- **Parallel agents** modify code concurrently — autonomy violations become race conditions
- **Ephemeral agents** complete one task and exit — there's no persistent "memory" of the rules
- **Headless agents** (running in CI, cron jobs, or triggered by events) have no interactive session at all

The question: **how do you enforce CLEAR principles when there's no persistent session to hold the rules?**

The answer: **make enforcement stateless**.

`verify-ci.sh` is already stateless — it's a script that runs against the current state of the filesystem. `autonomy.yml` is a static YAML file any process can read. Neither requires a loaded AI session to be enforced.

## Autonomy Boundaries in Multi-Agent Workflows

### The risk: agents that skip the check

In a single session, the AI reads CLEAR config at startup and checks autonomy.yml before every file modification. In an orchestrated pipeline, a sub-agent may:
- Have no knowledge of CLEAR or autonomy.yml
- Be a different AI system entirely (GPT-4, Gemini, local model)
- Be spawned with a minimal system prompt focused only on its subtask

**The solution: enforce autonomy at the orchestrator level.**

Before delegating a subtask to a sub-agent, the orchestrator (or a pre-flight step) should:

1. Identify which files the sub-task will likely touch
2. Look up their autonomy levels in `clear/autonomy.yml`
3. Refuse to delegate if any path is `humans-only`
4. Include `supervised` path warnings in the sub-agent's instructions

**Example orchestrator pre-flight prompt:**

```
Before assigning this task to a sub-agent, check clear/autonomy.yml.

Task: "Add rate limiting to the payment endpoint"
Files likely touched: src/payment/processor.ts, src/middleware/rate-limit.ts

For each file:
- If humans-only: do NOT delegate. Flag for human attention.
- If supervised: include a note in the sub-agent instructions: 
  "⚠ This path requires human review before commit."
- If full-autonomy: proceed normally.

Only delegate if no humans-only paths are involved.
```

### Architecture test: autonomy guard for pipelines

The `clear/templates/architecture-tests/autonomy-guard.test.js` template can be run as a pre-commit or CI gate, catching any changes that touch `humans-only` paths regardless of which agent made them:

```javascript
// tests/architecture/autonomy-guard.test.js
test('no commits touch humans-only paths without explicit override', () => {
  const changedFiles = getChangedFiles(); // git diff --name-only HEAD
  const humansOnly = getHumansOnlyPaths('clear/autonomy.yml');
  
  const violations = changedFiles.filter(f => 
    humansOnly.some(p => f.startsWith(p))
  );
  
  expect(violations).toHaveLength(0);
});
```

This is your last line of defense — runs in CI even if no agent ever checked autonomy.yml.

---

## verify-ci.sh as the Universal Gate

`verify-ci.sh` is the most portable CLEAR primitive for multi-agent use. Every agent, regardless of its AI provider or session state, should run it before reporting work complete.

### Passing the gate requirement to any agent

For sub-agents in your pipeline, include this in every task prompt:

```
After completing your changes, run:
  ./clear/verify-ci.sh

Do not report the task as complete until all checks pass.
If the script fails, fix the errors and run again.
```

This is provider-agnostic. It works whether the sub-agent is Claude, GPT-4, a local model, or a scripted tool.

### CI/CD as the final backstop

Even if a sub-agent skips `verify-ci.sh`, the GitHub Actions workflow in `clear/templates/github-actions/ci.yml` catches it at PR time. The pipeline runs the same checks — no agent can merge code that fails them.

## MCP Integration

[MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is the emerging standard for giving AI agents structured, typed access to tools and data sources. Exposing CLEAR as MCP tools makes enforcement available to any MCP-compatible agent or orchestrator without requiring bash execution or file reading.

### Why MCP for CLEAR?

| Without MCP | With MCP |
|-------------|----------|
| Agent must parse autonomy.yml manually | Agent calls `clear_check_autonomy(path)` → gets typed result |
| Orchestrator runs bash to invoke verify-ci.sh | Orchestrator calls `clear_verify()` → gets structured pass/fail + error list |
| Sub-agents have no discoverable enforcement interface | CLEAR tools are discoverable in the MCP server manifest |
| Provider-specific prompt engineering required | Any MCP-compatible agent uses the same tool interface |

### The three CLEAR MCP tools

**`clear_verify`** — runs `clear/verify-ci.sh` and returns structured results:
```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "passed": ["TypeScript build", "ESLint"],
  "failed": [{"check": "Jest", "output": "3 tests failed:\n  ..."}],
  "summary": "2/3 checks passed"
}
```

**`clear_check_autonomy`** — looks up a path in `clear/autonomy.yml`:
```json
{
  "path": "src/payment/processor.ts",
  "matched_rule": "src/payment",
  "level": "humans-only",
  "reason": "Money movement; AI errors are financial risk"
}
```

**`clear_list_humans_only`** — returns all `humans-only` paths; useful for pre-flight checks:
```json
{
  "humans_only_paths": ["src/payment", "src/auth/core", "ORIGIN.md"]
}
```

### Scaffolding a CLEAR MCP server

Use the skill template at `clear/templates/skills/mcp-server.md` to generate a minimal MCP server for your project. The template generates a Node.js or Python server that wraps these three tools.

```
Follow clear/templates/skills/mcp-server.md to scaffold a CLEAR MCP server
for this project.
```

Register the server in your Claude Code settings:

```json
// .claude/settings.json (or ~/.claude/settings.json for global)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "clear": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./mcp/clear-server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Once registered, Claude Code (and any other MCP client) can call these tools directly:
- `mcp__clear__clear_verify` — run CI checks
- `mcp__clear__clear_check_autonomy` — check a path
- `mcp__clear__clear_list_humans_only` — list restricted paths

## Multi-Agent Patterns with CLEAR

### Pattern 1: Orchestrator + Sub-agents

```
Orchestrator
  ├── Pre-flight: clear_list_humans_only → identify restricted zones
  ├── Task assignment: include autonomy level in each sub-agent prompt
  ├── Sub-agent A: implements feature (runs clear_verify before reporting done)
  ├── Sub-agent B: writes tests (runs clear_verify before reporting done)
  └── Post-flight: orchestrator calls clear_verify as final gate
```

**Key rule:** The orchestrator enforces autonomy. Sub-agents enforce verification. Both run `clear_verify` — sub-agents after their own work, orchestrator after all sub-agents complete.

### Pattern 2: Parallel Code Generation

When multiple agents modify different parts of the codebase in parallel:

1. Each agent checks its target paths via `clear_check_autonomy` before starting
2. `humans-only` paths block delegation entirely — the agent should not start
3. `supervised` paths get a flag in the agent's instructions
4. Each agent runs `clear_verify` independently when done
5. A merge/integration step runs `clear_verify` one final time on the combined result

This prevents one agent's changes from breaking another agent's work only after they're combined.

### Pattern 3: Headless / Event-Driven Agents

Agents triggered by webhooks, CI events, or scheduled jobs have no interactive session. They should:

1. Read `clear/autonomy.yml` at startup and refuse to touch `humans-only` paths
2. Run `./clear/verify-ci.sh` (or call `clear_verify` via MCP) as the final step
3. Fail loudly (non-zero exit) if verification fails — let the pipeline catch it

The GitHub Actions template at `clear/templates/github-actions/ci.yml` is exactly this pattern: a headless agent that runs `verify-ci.sh` on every PR.

### Pattern 4: Agentic Code Review

Instead of a human reviewing every AI-generated PR, use an agent that:

1. Calls `clear_verify` — if it fails, the PR is not ready for review
2. Calls `clear_list_humans_only` — flags any changes to restricted paths
3. Checks that new tests are constraint tests, not confirmation tests (see [docs/principles/assertive.md](principles/assertive.md))
4. Posts a structured report: "CLEAR checks: ✅ Passed / ❌ Autonomy violation in src/payment"

This turns CLEAR enforcement from a human responsibility into an automated gate.

## What CLEAR Does Not Solve in Multi-Agent Contexts

CLEAR is an architectural guardrail, not a coordination protocol. It does not:

- **Manage agent communication** — use a proper orchestration framework (LangGraph, CrewAI, Claude Agents SDK) for that
- **Prevent conflicting concurrent writes** — handle file locking or task partitioning at the orchestrator level
- **Replace integration tests** — `verify-ci.sh` runs unit/architecture tests locally; full integration tests still need a real environment
- **Audit which agent made which change** — use `git blame` and commit messages for attribution; structure agent commits with clear messages

CLEAR's job is to ensure that whatever any agent generates, it passes your architectural invariants before it reaches review or merge. The coordination of *how* agents work together is a separate problem.
