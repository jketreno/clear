# /project:verify — Run CLEAR verification

Runs `./scripts/verify-ci.sh` and reports a structured summary of results.

## Instructions

Execute the following and report results clearly:

```bash
./scripts/verify-ci.sh 2>&1
```

After running:
1. State clearly: **PASSED** or **FAILED**
2. If failed, list each failing check by name
3. For each failure, show the relevant error output (not the full log)
4. Propose specific fixes for each failure
5. Offer to fix and re-run: "Shall I fix these issues and run verify again?"

## Format
